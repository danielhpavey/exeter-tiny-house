We are working extremely hard to find innovative ways that our community can come to life without requiring everyone who lives here to have to invest financially. We recognise that with the current housing crisis, many of us canâ€™t even afford to save up a deposit or pay the rising rent costs here in the south-west. If our community can offer a local housing solution in this way that would be incredible. If you can help us with this, please do [get in touch](/contact).
