When we spend time working on our vision, we always talk about inclusivity and feel that our community should reflect this value. We envisage ETHC being a welcoming place for all who wish to choose this lifestyle and it’s important that our tiny house ‘village’ is connected with nearby communities too. We see our community as a small village where we do have our own private living spaces but we also thrive on connection, friendship and community support. This may involve shared gardening, sharing resources and hopefully a community space which we can use collectively.
