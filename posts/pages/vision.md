Exeter Tiny House Community is planning to create at least one community of tiny or compact homes in or around Exeter in Devon. We are a group of people who believe that living in smaller homes within a community is the answer to several issues:

**Living in harmony with the planet and each other:**  
We envisage providing a regenerative space to nurture people and to help nature thrive. We highly value the importance of working with, connecting to and respecting nature in all that we do. 


We prioritise the development and nurturing of our relationships with each other and even though we do not yet have a site, we already function as a working community. We believe in inclusivity and feel our community should reflect and actively promote this value. We use consent based decision making (sociocracy) to govern our group. 

**Connection and Resilience:**  
We are passionate about creating an intergenerational ‘village’ like space to be truly resilient in these times of uncertainty. 

As well as our own private individual/family units, we plan to have a collective indoor space plus share growing, relaxation and playing spaces. We are also keen to connect with the wider community in Exeter and Devon and promote the community as a flagship project which can be replicated.

**Affordability:**  
We feel it’s important to create inclusive nurturing communities for people to live in. Many of us cannot even afford a deposit for a home now - so our community seeks to make smaller homes affordable and available to everyone. 

**Ecological Footprint:**  
We aim to inspire and encourage others with a resilient and caring model for living lightly on our planet. Small homes are easier and cheaper to run, heat, use less and create less waste. We would share collective items as a group rather than us all owning duplicates. 

**Sustainability:**  
This is at the heart of our shared vision. We recognise the environmental importance of using truly sustainable locally sourced materials to create our buildings, using renewable sources for our energy needs, growing food and living simply without needless exploitation of the planet’s depleted resources. Insulation and preservation of energy is key too as is using local labour and artisanship. 

We are aware of the need to mitigate for climate change and future-proof our community and will be exploring land with its own water source and using renewable energy and energy reducing building techniques where possible. 


# Shared Values

We have taken some time to create this shared group agreement. We feel it brings our vision to life, making our needs and desires more tangible and clear. 

It is a living document that will be reviewed and amended as the community requires but reflects the vision and aspirations that we are calling new members to.

## Community Living

- We believe in inclusivity and feel our community should reflect and actively promote this value.
- We prioritise the development and nurturing of our relationships with each other.
 - We are passionate about creating an intergenerational 'village' like community to be truly resilient in these times of uncertainty.
- We use consent based decision making (sociocracy) to govern our group.
- We highly value the importance of working with, connecting to and respecting nature in all that we do.
- We should seek to balance independence with group engagement/responsibility.
- We are keen to connect with the wider community in Exeter and Devon.
- We will create policies as and when we need them, for example pandemics.
- All our shared community meals will be vegan.
- The community will have some quiet areas.
- We welcome more than human species who are part of each family unit in the community eg dogs, cats.
- We would like to promote our community as a great example of tiny house/community living which can be replicated.
- We aspire to use transport that is as sustainable as possible.

## Location

- We are all passionate about living with nature so our site must embrace this with plants, trees, wildlife etc.
- Our site will be within a reasonable distance of an established settlement/community. 
- Our site must not be too exposed so we can grow food (particularly with extreme weather events increasing).
- Ideally, our site will be near enough water (sea, river, lake etc) to access it but not near enough to be flooded or impacted by rising sea levels/extreme weather etc.
- The site must be accessible to service vehicles (eg. ambulances/deliveries).
- We will ensure we choose a site that is not exposed (or has potential to be) to pollution ie. air, noise, environmental, industrial, agricultural etc.
- We do not want a site directly adjacent to or adversely affected by a major road, railway line or airport/flight path.
- We will endeavour to be out of sight or sound of farm buildings where animals are being harmed.
- We will not be within sight or sound of a slaughterhouse.

# Services

- We will aim to be as off grid or energy self-sufficient as possible (although we appreciate this could take time to achieve).
- Insulation and preservation of energy and resources is key so we don't use more than we need.
- Mobile phone connection is essential.
- Internet connection is essential.
- We require a water source, preferably spring/borehole so we are self-sufflicient

# Outside Spaces

- We will have a mix of private outside spaces & communal outside spaces.
- Our site will have space for a shared growing area or access to one nearby.
- Rewilding is important to us and should be incorporated if possible.
- We will not allow rights on our land for others to shoot/fish there etc.
- We are committed to protecting and preserving the integrity of the ecosystems where we live
- Our site will include play areas for children - trees/playpark area etc.
- It is very important to us that there are trees either on site or close by.
- We are in general agreement that we want to grow organically & endeavour to cause as least harm to other species as possible. We will discuss the details of this further when we are developing the site.
- It is not a priority but having a place to swim nearby is desirable.

# Design

- We recognise the environmental importance of using truly sustainable locally sourced or reclaimed materials to create our buildings.
- We will use energy reducing building techniques where possible.
- We will use local labour and artisanship wherever possible.
- We will have a shared communal space for events/special meals etc and laundry & guest accommodation etc. (common house).
- There will be provision for a covered bike shed and other storage.
- We will be encouraging the use of compost toilets, heat pumps, solar panels etc and will use these in shared accommodation/common areas.
