Land Ahoy! 

Here are two members of our new Sites circle Diane and Sharon spending a lovely morning together on a site visit near Exeter. 

This new circle (or working group) is tasked to find our first site. This is no mean feat considering the planning challenges we face! Add to that the price of land and shortage of affordable land being available locally and you can see this circle has their work cut out for them! 

However, we are fortunate that the foundational work our Entity Circle did with funders has lined up a potential source of funding to purchase land. Now we just need to find a site. So if you're reading this and know of land for sale near Exeter or would like to join Exeter Tiny House Community and help us look for a site, please [get in touch today](/contact).
