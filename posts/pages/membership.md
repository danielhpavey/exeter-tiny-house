 - Inform yourself about ETHC by joining the [Facebook Group](https://en-gb.facebook.com/groups/exetertinyhousecommunity/) and reading the relevant content and/or familiarising yourself with the website, especially the Vision and shared values, which identify what we are agreeing to when we join.

 - Apply to join the working group by completing the application form on the website. 

 - Zoom with a member of the community to give more detail, explain sociocracy, circles etc and answer questions.

 - Meet, in-person, members of the community, ideally attending an in- person social, or if not possible, meeting for coffee and a chat. 

 - Observe circle meetings.

 -  Join a circle and get a ‘buddy’.

 - Get access to What’s App, google docs etc.

 Because membership of this group is the route to residency, all working group members are required to take an active role.

This includes contributing to circle activities by volunteering for tasks and ensuring circle roles and actions are shared fairly.   

Members will attend meetings and socials, take an active role in them and give apologies if unable to be present. 

If a member is inactive for 3 months (agreement may be made in exceptional circumstances), they will be asked to leave the group. In those circumstances, they will be contacted and given 2 weeks to discuss circumstances before a decision is made by the whole group.
