"I was born in Cornwall and brought up in Devon, lived in Sidmouth and went to school in Exeter. Although I have lived in the South East of England for over 40 years now, my aim is to re-locate to the South West. I started to get interested in the Tiny House movement about 5 years ago, and I am so glad to see that it has finally started to take off in the UK. For me, tiny house/sustainable living is the only way forward â€“ and housing solutions that are sensitive to local (and global) environments, are the only responsible way to get us out of the current housing crisis. I am committed to Green politics, renewable energy and community responsibility for our threatened environment"
