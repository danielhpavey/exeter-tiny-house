We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new vision page at [www.exetertinyhousecommunity.org/vision](https://www.exetertinyhousecommunity.org/vision). This page is a culmination of months of hard work and dedication from our team to articulate our vision for the future of our tiny house community.

As a community, we believe in the power of tiny homes to create sustainable, affordable, and community-oriented living spaces. Our vision is to create a thriving community where individuals can live in harmony with nature, connect with their neighbors, and live a simpler, more intentional life.

On our [vision page](/vision), you will find a detailed overview of our communityâ€™s values, goals, and plans for the future. We have included information on our commitment to sustainability, our plans for community gardens and shared spaces, and our vision for a vibrant, inclusive community.

We believe that our [vision](/vision) page will be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in learning more about our community and our mission. Whether you are a potential resident, a community partner, or simply someone interested in the tiny house movement, we invite you to explore our vision page and learn more about our community.

We are excited to continue working towards our vision for a sustainable, community-oriented future, and we hope that our [vision](/vision) page will inspire others to join us in this journey. Thank you for your support, and we look forward to sharing more updates with you in the future.
