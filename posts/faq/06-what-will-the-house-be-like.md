We are still in discussions about the kind of homes that will make up our community. We like the idea of people getting to create the home they wish and dream of but this may not be completely possible for several reasons. Homes may be on wheels or a fixed foundation, made of steel or glass or locally sourced timber for example. They might each come with a garden plot or a smaller garden and then we could all share a community garden and orchard. We have added photos of different Tiny Homes all over this website to give you an idea of the many different types of design available.
