It's generally accepted that a residence under 500 square feet (46 m2) is a tiny home. These little houses do come in all shapes and sizes though, on foundations or wheels and can suit one person or a family.

The Tiny House movement that is becoming more established across the world advocates living simply in small compact homes.

Those of us who choose or plan to live this way usually do so for several reasons. It's a more affordable way to live especially in these times of financial challenge. The homes are cheaper to create and usually much cheaper to run.

Living in a tiny home is choosing to leave a much smaller ecological footprint on the planet. This includes stepping away from a consumer driven lifestyle by choosing to have less 'stuff' and share resources.

Many tiny home owners choose to create their homes in an eco-friendly way using sustainable materials and some use renewable energy to power them. The homes can be sited individually or together as a community which is what we are planning here in or around Exeter.
