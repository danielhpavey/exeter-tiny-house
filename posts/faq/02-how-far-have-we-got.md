A group of us came together in the spring of 2020 and connected over zoom at first (through several lockdowns). We worked on planning, researching, learning, networking, creating a vision and moving towards forming a legal entity. We feel it is important to spend time finding interested and committed people and getting to know the humans and other than humans who will eventually live in a community together. Some of us have worked together now for over two years and we welcome new community members. See our [About Us](/about) page for more info.
