- **Step 1** - Familiarise yourself with the [ETHC Facebook Page](https://en-gb.facebook.com/groups/exetertinyhousecommunity/) and the website. There is quite a lot of useful information on the [FAQs](/faq) page and we will be happy to answer any further questions you might have through the [contact page](/contact).
- **Step 2** - Join the [Exeter Tiny House Community Facebook Page](https://en-gb.facebook.com/groups/exetertinyhousecommunity/).  We ask you to answer 3 simple questions to help us on the journey of getting to know each other.
- **Step 3** - Attend a Zoom Q & A session.  We hold these about every 6 weeks.  It’s an opportunity to introduce yourself, meet some of the members of the community, find out our latest news and activities and ask any questions that you might have.
- **Step 4** - Complete a Membership Form.  This helps us to see if our vision and values are aligned and gives you a chance to share the skills and experience that you would be bringing to the community.
- **Step 5** - You get a ‘Buddy’. Our buddying system helps to make sure that you get all the information that you need in this membership process and supports your integration into the group.
- **Step 6** - Circle observation. You will be invited to observe at several circle meetings.  This will give you an idea of how we work in circles and also what each of the circles entails.  From there you will be able to decide which circle you would be most suited to join. In Sociocracy, nothing is forever.  So moving between circles is easy and, at certain times, may be necessary if a particular project requires more people etc.
- **Step 7** - Join the General What’s App group. You will be party to the general chat between members
- **Step 8** - Join a Circle. Currently these are Entity, Communications and Wellbeing.  More groups will be established as the group grows and the need for other circles arises.

**Welcome you are a fully active member**
