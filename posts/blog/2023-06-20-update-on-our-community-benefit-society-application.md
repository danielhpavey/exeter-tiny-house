Reaching our Crowdfunder target was a huge step forward for ETHC (and huge thanks to all who contributed!). To achieve our next goal, our Entity Circle has been working very hard to complete our application to become a Community Benefit Society – the next major step forward in ETHC’s development. 

Working under the guidance of Wessex Community Assets who are experts in this area, the application has now been signed off by the Directors, and we hope to have further news very soon.

If you want to know more about CBSs and how they work, there is a lot of information available online – try <https://cwmpas.coop/what-is-a-community-benefit-society/>
