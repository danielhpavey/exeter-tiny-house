"I believe in living in a way that puts less pressure on the limited resources of the earth and
helps re-generate valuable ecosystems rather than destroying them. Iâ€™m really excited about
the ETHC because it has community-based sustainability and care for the environment at its
core.
I am a climate activist with admin and facilitation skills to share. By setting up tiny house
communities we are able to tackle issues of inequalities and social injustices exacerbated by
climate change. I believe we only see change if we act to be part of it. We need to devise
our own solutions to housing to combat mindless exploitation of our planet. That is why
groups like ETHC are vital for the future."
