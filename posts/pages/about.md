Exeter Tiny House Community came to life back in early 2020 and due to the pandemic was only able to meet over zoom for quite a while. We did have regular meetings and took part in workshops and training events to try and get ourselves skilled up with what we would need in order to move the idea forward. The idea being... that we create a community of tiny homes in or around Exeter in Devon.


Some of the group parted way due to other commitments, general life stuff and also location. Some of the group wanted to live further south of Exeter and have since gone on to start their own projects. We keep in touch with these folks as well as other Tiny House projects around the UK as we are really keen to support each other and know that when one succeeds, it can only help us all.

With just two people remaining and after a bit of a rest throughout the winter, we restarted the group in spring 2022. There was a lot of interest at this time and several new people joined the group bringing their energy, skills, enthusiasm and kind souls.

We are now collectively working on our vision and moving forward with creating a legal entity (eg a Co-operative, Community Benefit Society or Community Land Trust). We envisage exploring relationships with local councils, landowners, housing associations and tiny house builders to make our dream a reality.

For anyone interested in joining us, we ask for a commitment to give one hour a week to a zoom meeting and a morning once a month to meet in person in Exeter.
