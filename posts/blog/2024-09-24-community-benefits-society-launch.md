Hello and welcome to autumn!

We have exciting news for you in this short email !

We here at Exeter Tiny House Community are very pleased to announce that our official launch as a Community Benefit Society is happening on Saturday 5th October and you are invited. 

Join us at [Exeter Community Centre on St David's Hill](https://www.eccentre.org) between 2 and 4pm. There will be refreshments and a Question & Answer session for anyone interested in joining us as we move ahead to the stage of purchasing land to live on together in community. 

Children are very welcome but unfortunately dogs are not allowed in the centre. It's a 7 minute walk from both Exeter Central and Exeter St David's train stations and 10 minutes from the bus station. There's bike parking on the street outside and more bike racks through the door to the right of the entrance into the courtyard. There is disabled access to the building and to the room we are in upstairs. 

Please [email](/contact) us back to let us know if you are intending to come so we have an idea of numbers. Let us know if you have any special requirements so we can make your visit more comfortable. 

If you can't make this date, let us know as we may put on an online session at a later date for interested folks. 

Thank you for your continued support. 

Exeter Tiny House Community
