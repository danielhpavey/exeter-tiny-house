“I’m looking forward to seeing Exeter’s Tiny House Community develop and hopefully being a useful part of that.  I feel community enhances my life and see that it comes together naturally when like minded people meet.  I am passionate about living a low-impact lifestyle in tune with the planet and living in community can contribute to that.  I hope that what is now seen as an ‘alternative’ way of living will become the norm for the benefit of people and planet.”
