One of our members Sharon attended this 2 hour long zoom on Sunday 4th June 2023 and here are her words:

What an incredibly exciting and inspirational session! This Inaugural meeting was a collective attempt to start the ball rolling towards creating a national organisation to promote and support the Tiny House movement in the UK. 

Hosted by Prana Simon, the zoom started with some context and background from Rachel Butler from [Tiny House Bristol Community](https://www.tinyhousecommunitybristol.org/). Pooran Desai talked about his experience with the [One Planet Living project](https://oneplanet.com/). 

Climate change and the ecological crisis was a dominant theme throughout this meeting. 

Pooran explained how solving issues in silos is not effective or joined up and asked if we could work in a more joined up way. 

Systems thinking and interconnectedness was mentioned in that we need new solutions. We need resilient people, communities and a resilient planet. And Tiny homes could be part of this. 

We spent time in smaller groups in a dreaming space together imagining how we would like to move forward and harvesting our thoughts. 

So excited to see where this goes next. If you're interested in getting involved follow [facebook.com/groups/tinyhousecommunityuk](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tinyhousecommunityuk) or [contact us](/contact) at Exeter Tiny House Community.
