Here's the latest from ETHC. Our Crowdfunder has reached the halfway point and we are so grateful to all of you who have got us this far. 

The Entity Circle is very busy working through the paperwork with Wessex Community Assets and our status as a Community Benefit Society is on the horizon. We are so excited to reach this milestone and are planning some kind of celebratory launch, so watch this space for more details. 

In the meantime, the Comms Circle are almost ready to publish our first newsletter and are focused on recruiting new members to the working group. 

The Wellbeing and Training circle will meet next week to discuss the best use of the finances available to support the development of the Community. 

Please checkout the rest of this website for any questions you might have.

There are [FAQs](/faq) but we would also love to hear from you via the [contact form](/contact).
